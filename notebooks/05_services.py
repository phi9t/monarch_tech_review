    # Services: Building a Generator Pool

    We just introduced async RL and why it matters. If you've used Claude Code or any coding-capable AI, you know that depending on the difficulty of your question, it could take a really long time to generate even one trajectory. As we showed in the previous notebook, there's also significant variance in how long generation takes.

    For this reason, you'll typically want to run RL workloads with **many generator replicas running in parallel**.

    ## The "Service" Abstraction

    When you get to this point, there are a few ways you could model this. A pretty natural approach is to create a **"service"**.

    In traditional software engineering, a service is a component that:
    - Handles requests from clients
    - Can be replicated for throughput and reliability
    - Lives behind some kind of load balancer (think Kubernetes)

    This idea applies here too. You *could* find and grab an off-the-shelf implementation, but since we're always working in Python, it would be nice to have a **Python-native implementation** - especially one you can easily customize to match your needs as an RL researcher.

    ## What We'll Build

    There are a lot of ideas that could go into a service, but what we'll focus on implementing here - using **pure Monarch** - is a service that can:

    1. **Load balance** across replicas (round-robin for simplicity, but you could implement more exotic strategies based on your workload)
    2. **Track and respond to faults** (health tracking, retry with different replica)
    3. **Be discoverable** (services register themselves, clients find them by name)
    4. **Support multi-GPU replicas** (each replica is an ActorMesh that can span multiple GPUs)
    5. **Target specific replicas** (grab a replica and keep using it - useful for stateful interactions)

    Since each replica is an ActorMesh, everything we build here *could* run multi-host - the abstraction supports it. For this tutorial, we'll run on a single node to keep things simple.

    ## Quick Recap: Monarch Actors

    Before we dive in, a quick refresher on the Monarch primitives we'll use. If you've gone through the earlier notebooks, you'll recognize these:

    - **`@endpoint`** - Marks a method as callable from other actors. Returns a `Future` that you `.get()` to await.
    - **`__supervise__`** - Called when a child actor fails. You can log the error and decide whether to handle it.
    - **`get_or_spawn_controller`** - Gets or creates a singleton actor by name. First caller spawns it, subsequent callers get the existing one.
    - **`ActorMesh`** - A group of actors spawned together. When you call an endpoint, it runs on all actors in the mesh.

    With that in mind, let's think about what API we want for our service.

    ## A Key Assumption: 1 Replica = 1 ActorMesh

    Most workloads we care about will need to span multiple GPUs. A 70B model needs tensor parallelism across 8 GPUs. Models like DeepSeek V3 may need to span multiple *hosts*.

    So rather than treating single-GPU replicas as the default and multi-GPU as a special case, we'll make a basic assumption: **1 replica = 1 ActorMesh**.

    This means:
    - Each replica is a group of workers (an ActorMesh)
    - Workers within a replica coordinate via **collectives** - each replica is its own distributed "world"
    - The service manages replicas, not individual workers

    This design composes naturally with the existing ML ecosystem. A common pattern might be to plug **vLLM** or another inference engine into one of these meshes - it just sees a standard distributed environment.

    If you happen to have a small model that fits on one GPU, you just have a replica with 1 worker. The abstraction still works.

    ## Designing the API First

    Before we implement anything, let's sketch what we want the usage to look like. This helps us work backwards to the implementation.

    **What a client wants to do:**
    ```python
    # Get a service by name
    gen_service = get_service("generators")

    # Get a replica and call it
    replica, replica_idx = gen_service.get_replica_with_idx()
    result = replica.generate(task)

    # If something fails, mark it unhealthy and retry
    gen_service.mark_unhealthy(replica_idx)
    ```

    **What a service wants to do on startup:**
    ```python
    # Register itself so clients can find it
    register_service("generators", self)
    ```

    This gives us a clean separation: services register themselves, clients discover them by name. You *can* pass actor references around directly - that works fine - but referring to services by name is often a cleaner pattern, especially when services and clients are spawned independently.

    Key design decisions:

    1. **1 replica = 1 ActorMesh** - Each replica can span multiple GPUs (or even hosts)
    2. **Pass replica_id at spawn** - Workers know which replica they belong to
    3. **Caller registers the service** - After spawning, the caller calls `register_service()`. We can't do this in `__init__` because actors can't block on Futures during initialization.
    4. **Round-robin routing** - Simple, predictable, works well when replicas are similar
    5. **Caller marks unhealthy** - The service doesn't automatically detect which replica failed. Instead, the caller tells it after catching an exception.
    6. **Health probes for recovery** - Workers have a `ping()` endpoint. The service's `check_health()` method probes unhealthy replicas and recovers them if they respond.

    ## What We Built

    A simple but complete service framework:

    | Component | Responsibility |
    |-----------|---------------|
    | **`get_service(name)`** | Find a service by name |
    | **`register_service(name, svc)`** | Register a service for discovery |
    | **Worker** | Does the actual work, knows its replica_id and local_rank |
    | **Service** | Owns replicas (ActorMeshes), routes requests, tracks health |

    The pattern:
    1. Services register themselves on startup with `register_service()`
    2. Clients discover services with `get_service()`
    3. Clients get replicas, make calls, handle failures inline
    4. On failure, mark unhealthy and retry with a different replica

    ## What's Missing?

    The generators need **updated weights** after the trainer takes a gradient step. Right now they'd be using stale weights forever.

    How do we efficiently sync weights from trainer to generators?

    **Next notebook: RDMA Weight Sync** - Using Monarch's RDMA primitives to transfer weights without blocking training.
